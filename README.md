# g2i-Golang-2025


Description:
Write a Go program that:

1. Splits a slice of integers into N nearly equal parts.

2. Starts N goroutines to compute the sum of each part.

3. Combines all partial sums to return the total sum.

Note: Solving this using channels is encouraged and considered a plus, as it demonstrates idiomatic use of Goâ€™s concurrency model.
